# Patatap-Simplified-Clone
www.patatap.com is recreational website, while visiting this sites it plays piano like sounds and show 2d animated graphics of various shape on a-z key press.

This repository contain simplified clone version of patatap. Here, I have learned to use "paper.js"(provide good animation) and "howler.js"(add sounds) are two javascript libraries. This project is uncomplete. Because there is no sound on keypress envent like original site. All browsers policy have changed, so they don't support autoplay audio without taking permission from user But I don't know how to do that yet.

I hope, I will know it soon and will complete this project.
So, here is the complete vesion of patatap simplified clone
